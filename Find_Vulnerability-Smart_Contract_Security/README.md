# Security Problem Reentrancy Attack

### Problem: Add my address to the winners array.
-Challenge contract has a function (exploit_me) that adds addresses to the winners array but there is a boolean value (lock) that needs to be flipped first in order to commplete the call. <br />
-The function that changes address(exploit_me) has a weakness in "msg.sender.call("");" line where it enables a Reentrancy attack. <br />

### Solution: Create a attacker contract and use Reentrancy with the fallback function to gain access
-Use the attacker contract to call the function(exploit_me) that adds my address to the winners array <br />
-Use fallback function of the attacker contract in order to respond to the "msg.sender.call("");" line that is vulnerable and change the boolean value <br />
-Address successfully added to the winners array - task complete <br />

### Proof

Challenge contract: https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0xcD7AB80Da7C893f86fA8deDDf862b74D94f4478E#code <br />
My attacking contract: https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x596549c68abb7d2f1dcb56b92d40bea816b02ca8 <br />
My address can be seen by calling winners(0) here: https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0xcD7AB80Da7C893f86fA8deDDf862b74D94f4478E#readContract <br />
<br />
My address: 0x2eE648bb7882d236c2aAce994Ab6143B3bc06744<br />
